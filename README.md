HTML 🧱: Create the structure of your Pong game. Use the <canvas> element to serve as the playground where the game will be rendered.
CSS 🎨: Style the  canvas, center it on the page, and give it a cool, boxed frame to make it look polished.
JavaScript 🧠: This is where the magic happens! Implement the game logic, including paddle movements, ball dynamics, collision detection, and AI for the computer-controlled paddle.
Setting Up the Canvas 🖼️:

Create a responsive canvas element that adjusts based on screen size.
Use CSS to style it with a border, background color, and even a glowing effect for a modern look.
Implementing the Game Logic 🕹️:

Ball Movement ⚽: Make the ball move across the canvas, bouncing off the walls and paddles.
Paddles 🏓: Allow the player to control the left paddle using the up and down arrow keys, while the right paddle is controlled by a simple AI.
Collision Detection 💥: Ensure the ball bounces off the paddles and the top/bottom edges.
Adding a Watermark 💧:

Add a subtle watermark to the center of the game frame with the text "Sukesh Pong Game". This gives the game a branded touch without interfering with gameplay.
Refining the Visuals 🎨:

Use CSS to make the game visually appealing. Add borders, shadows, and a centered watermark for a professional look.
Game Loop 🔄:

Implement a game loop in JavaScript that continuously updates the game state and renders the elements on the canvas, providing smooth gameplay.
Test and Play 🎉:

Load the  game in a browser, test the controls, and enjoy a classic game of Pong with your custom tweaks.
Building this Pong game is a fun and interactive way to practice your web development skills. Plus, you get to enjoy a retro game you've built yourself! 🕹️💻🎮
